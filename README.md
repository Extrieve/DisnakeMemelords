# DisnakeMemelords
 Disnake discord bot for personal discord server.
This project is a refactor/migration process from [Link text Here](https://github.com/Extrieve/MemelordsBot)
Moving this project from discord.py to Disnake because of new features such as slash_commands.

Some of the major bot functionality includes:
* **Anime**: Search for anime and get information about it. Look for anime openings, endings, and more.
* **Search**: Search for images, word definitions, and more.
* **Fun**: Get random images, quotes, and more.
* **General Purpose**: Get information about the server, get a random image, and more.
* **Admin**: Get information about the server, moderate the server, and more.

The bots databases were achieved by using scraping libraries such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
A lot of the bot functionality is still in development. TODO: Add music functionality.

Before running the application for yourself you must have a discord account and a bot account.
Make sure you have the correct permissions to run the bot.
Make sure you configure your own bot token in the config.py file (this is gitignored for privacy concerns).

To run the application locally, run the bot.py file.
 ```python
python3 bot.py
 ```
